# SimpleHuffmanCompression
A simple implementation of Huffman Compression using modern C. 

The initial upload contains an incomplete implementation. Characters must be extended to a 256-bit length. The compression process must be altered to accomidate for this. The decompression algorithm is known but unimplimented, as of now.
